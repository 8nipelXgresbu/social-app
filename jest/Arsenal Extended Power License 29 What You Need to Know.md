One of these features is the license system. The game has 29 different licenses that you can obtain by completing certain objectives or challenges. Each license grants you access to new units, buildings, technologies, or bonuses that can give you an edge in the game. For example, the Atomic Bomber license allows you to build a powerful bomber that can drop a nuclear bomb on your enemies. The Stealth license lets you build invisible units that can sneak past enemy defenses. The Super Tank license gives you a massive tank that can crush anything in its path.
 
But how do you get these licenses? Well, there are two ways. The first way is to play the game's campaign mode, which consists of 40 missions that span four different continents. Each mission has a specific license as a reward for completing it. The second way is to play the game's custom mode, which lets you create your own scenarios and maps. In custom mode, you can choose which licenses you want to start with, or you can enable the random license option, which will give you a random license every time you start a new game.
 
Arsenal Extended Power License 29 is one of the most coveted licenses in the game. It is called the Arsenal Extended Power license, and it gives you access to all the other licenses in the game. That means you can use any unit, building, technology, or bonus that the game has to offer. However, getting this license is not easy. You have to complete all 40 missions in the campaign mode on hard difficulty. This will test your skills and strategy to the limit, as the enemies will be more aggressive, smarter, and stronger than ever.
